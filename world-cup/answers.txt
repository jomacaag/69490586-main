Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Well, with only 10 runs, brazil and argentina both had 40% of winning the tournamets. with only 100 runs that went down to 27% and 5% respectively


Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: After seeing the results i would call 1000 good enough, as its close enought to the million simulations,
if i had not known results would run each simulation 5ish times untill the results are similar each time
