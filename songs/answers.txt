1. For their audio aura i would characterize it by energy, and danceability.
2. many songs can have similar energy and similar dancability but it can also be a bad call because one could be doing chores at home and listen to many very dancable and energetic songs to keep them motivated. and the same songs can be used by a person workng out. two very disticnt activities but both requiring energy and motivation
